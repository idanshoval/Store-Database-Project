# My Store Database Project
The project utilizes APIs to pull data into a database called "Shop". 
Python and SQL are used to connect to the database and insert data into the tables.
The project is structured into two layers: Silver and Gold.

- The Silver layer organizes the data into tables while retaining the original data from the sources.
- The Gold layer focuses on combining the tables and creating reports to generate insights./N
Users can create a .env file with global variables to configure the project and execute it seamlessly. This structure enhances data management and enables effective reporting and analysis.
